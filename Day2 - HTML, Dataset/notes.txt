Review what we did last week.

	- Show the html page with the empty layout.
	- We talked about JQuery and how we can use that.
	- We talked about CSS.
	- We used JFiddle for this.

Added a list of metro parks.

Today

	1 - add css to the make the #header to make it positioned at the top, full width, and a height of 40px.  Make the background color dark gray.

	2 - Make #main with a top of 60px, the left 0, right 0, and bottom 0.  Make the font size 12px.

	3 - Now make the #parkMap abosute positioned, the top 0, the left 0, the righ 200px, and the bottom 0.

	4 - It's time now to do something with that list.  Make #parkList with a position of absolute, top 0, width 200px, right 0, bottom 0.  And, add "overflow: scroll" to this one.

	Bonus exercises

	#parkList li  - set this to have a height of 30px, a background color of grey, a font color of white, center the text and set the line height to 30px.

	#parkList li:hover - set the background color to light grey and the font color to black.
